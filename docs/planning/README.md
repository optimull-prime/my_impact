# Project Planning Documentation

This folder contains the initial project plans created at the start of each phase. These documents represent the intended scope and design at the time of planning.

## Phase Documents

- **[PHASE_0_1_STATUS.md](PHASE_0_1_STATUS.md)** - Phase 0 & Phase 1 completion status and planning
- **[PHASE_2_README.md](PHASE_2_README.md)** - Phase 2 project overview and features
- **[PHASE_2_BUILD_SUMMARY.md](PHASE_2_BUILD_SUMMARY.md)** - Phase 2 detailed build summary
- **[PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md](PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md)** - Phase 2 MVP delivery summary

## Purpose

These documents serve as:
1. **Historical record** of initial planning and scope
2. **Comparison baseline** to understand what was planned vs. what was actually implemented
3. **Reference** for understanding the original architecture and design decisions

## Comparing Plan vs. Reality

To understand what changed during development, compare these documents against the current state of the repository:

- Check what features were planned but not implemented
- Review architectural decisions and whether they were followed
- Identify scope creep or scope reduction from the original plan
- Understand trade-offs made during development
